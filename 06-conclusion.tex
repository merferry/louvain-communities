In conclusion, this report presents our parallel multicore implementation of the Louvain algorithm --- a high quality community detection method, which, as far as we are aware, stands as the most efficient implementation of the algorithm on multicore CPUs. Here, we considered $9$ different optimizations, which significantly improve the performance of the local-moving and the aggregation phases of the algorithm. On a server with dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, comparison with competitive open source implementations (Vite and Grappolo) and packages (NetworKit) show that our optimized implementation of Louvain, which we term as GVE-Louvain, is on average $50\times$, $22\times$, $20\times$, and $5.8\times$ faster than Vite, Grappolo, NetworKit Louvain, and cuGraph Louvain (run on an NVIDIA A100 GPU) respectively. In addition, GVE-Louvain on average obtains $3.2\%$ higher modularity than Vite\ignore{(especially on web graph)}, $0.6\%$ lower modularity than Grappolo and NetworKit Louvain\ignore{(especially on social networks with poor clustering)}, and $2.6\%$ higher modularity than cuGraph Louvain. On a web graph with $3.8$ billion edges, GVE-Louvain identifies communities in $6.8$ seconds, and thus achieves a processing rate of $560$ million edges/s. In addition, GVE-Louvain achieves a strong scaling factor of $1.6\times$ for every doubling of threads. Future work could focus of designing fast community detection algorithms that enable interactive updation of community memberships of vertices in large dynamic graphs.
